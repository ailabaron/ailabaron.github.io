According to statistics over 200 million people worldwide use Homeopathy. It is part of the National Health Service in several countries, including Switzerland and India and to a lesser degree the UK. In the UK there are 1500 Homeopaths and 500 Homeopathic doctors.

        <description>You have now taken the decision to explore homeopathy. There are two ways to proceed:
  You come and see me for Constitutional Treatment. This is the mainstream of Homeopathy. You have had a problem for a while and it has become quite chronic. This requires the skills of a professional homeopath to deal with, to find that special remedy that works on both physical and emotional levels. Allow a minimum of two hours for the first consultation (less for children) that is conducted in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.</description>
