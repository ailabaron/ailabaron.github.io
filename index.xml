        <description>If you have had a problem for a while and it has become chronic you can come and see me for, what we call, Constitutional treatment. This is where you require the skills of a professional Homeopath to find that unique remedy that works for you on both physical and emotional levels. Allow a minimum of two hours for the first consultation (less for children) which is conducted in a friendly, relaxed athmosphere.</description>
